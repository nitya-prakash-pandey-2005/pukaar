# Test log

One line per test: date and time, build, scenario, result, latency, notes.

| When (IST) | Build | Scenario | Result | Latency | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sun 8 Nov 13:20 | feat/tm-pukaar-domain | Live call, real Gnani + Groq (`qwen/qwen3.8-27b`). Caller = 4 Tamil lines spoken by Timbre "Prakash", streamed at real-time pace into `/ws/call` | Works end to end | Prisma STT 90–133 ms; reply audio starts ~2.0 s after the caller stops | Exact Tamil transcripts; triage reached critical 84 on "water up to the chest"; each reply = reassurance + one approved instruction in Tamil + one question in slot order. (TM) |
| Sun 8 Nov 14:30 | feat/tm-pukaar-domain | Noise drill, 6 synthetic calls × {clean, 20, 10, 5, 0 dB} rain, Prisma REST `indic-auto` | Triage accuracy flat from clean to 0 dB | Same-script CER 7.5% clean → 10.8% at 0 dB | Results: `docs/drill-results.md`. Small sample; clean row = LLM extraction variance. (TM) |

## Findings (Sun 8 Nov, TM)

- First live run: replies said "you are safe" / "help is coming" before any dispatch, and extraction invented facts (`water_level: none`, `trapped: false`), which stopped Pukaar from ever asking about water. Fixed in the prompts (`triage.py`); re-verified live.
- The model sometimes wrote a `[[ID]]` without saying the instruction (logged as given). The prompt now forbids it and puts the instruction before the question.
- Reply latency ~2.0 s: Prisma end-of-speech + fact extraction (~0.45 s) + reply (~0.3 s) + first TTS chunk. Next win: pre-rendered fillers like Dadi's `assets.load_or_make_fillers`.
- Delete `cache/pukaar.db` before recording a demo: a new call within 300 m and 3 h merges into old test incidents (dedup working as designed).

## Drill findings (Sun 8 Nov, TM)

- **Noise barely hurts.** Locality 67%, vulnerable F1 100% and severity level 67% are identical at clean and 0 dB; Tamil transcripts stay at ~3–7% CER even at 0 dB.
- **Keyterm bias.** With only 10 demo localities as keyterms, Prisma heard "Velachery" in noise where the caller said another area (case 3, 10/5/0 dB). Fixed: all 42 gazetteer localities are keyterms now. Not re-measured yet (needs another drill run = Gnani credits).
- **Script mismatch.** The LLM sometimes wrote callers in romanised Hinglish/Tanglish; Prisma correctly writes Devanagari/Tamil. CER now skips cross-script pairs; the writing prompt now asks for native script.
- **Tamil place names.** Prisma wrote சோழிநல்லூர் correctly, but the LLM transliterated it to "Chozhinallur". Fixed: when the LLM spelling does not map to the gazetteer, Pukaar matches the caller's own words against the Tamil aliases.
- **Groq budget per live turn (measured):** extraction ~530 tokens + reply ~470 tokens ≈ 1,000 tokens. One live call (4–6 turns/min) fits the free tier's 8k tokens/min; two simultaneous live calls, or a `fresh` surge during a call, do not. The default surge replays a recording (0 tokens).

## Sun 8 Nov night, branch `dilavesh` (TM)
- **Guard gap found and fixed:** "10 நிமிஷத்துல வருவோம்" (colloquial Tamil "we'll come in 10 minutes") passed the time-promise guard, which only knew min/मिनट/நிமிட. Now any minutes/hours word in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali, Malayalam or English, plus "coming soon" promises, triggers the safe fallback unless a dispatcher gave an ETA. Applies to live calls too.
- **SMS / WhatsApp intake (live, Groq only):** Tamil SMS (Velachery, 4 on the roof, chest-deep water, paati needs insulin) → text incident, **critical 84**, GPS + gazetteer; Hindi SMS (Saidapet, 3 people, waist-deep, sick child) → **high 57**, located by landmark; reply asks the next missing fact with approved guidance.
- **Dispatcher message relay (live):** "The boat is at the temple gate. Wave a white cloth." → "படகு கோவில் வாயிலில் உள்ளது. வெள்ளை துண்டை அசைக்கவும்." / "नौका मंदिर के द्वार पर है। सफेद कपड़ा लहराएँ।" (queued as callbacks because the SMS callers are not on a live call).
- **CAP 1.2 export:** broadcast alerts download as CAP XML (one `<info>` per language, status "Exercise"), the format India's SACHET alert platform uses.

## Tue 10 Nov 18:55–19:05, `main`, live product screenshots (CL)
- **Setup:** real Gnani + Groq (`qwen/qwen3.8-27b`), fresh `cache/pukaar.db`. Caller = 3 Tamil lines spoken by Timbre "Prakash" (Velachery bus stop, 4 people on the roof, chest-deep water, 80-year-old grandmother needs insulin, a small child), played into Chrome's fake microphone in real time; 3 calls.
- **Calls:** Prisma wrote every line in Tamil script with the meaning intact (e.g. நாங்க → நாங்கள்). Severity reached critical 90 (flood 20, chest 30, roof 10, elderly + child 14, insulin 10, 4 people 6). Calls 2 and 3 merged into the call-1 incident (4 callers with one surge caller). Control-room "average reply time" (LLM time to first reply sentence) 0.72–1.05 s. The last reply of calls 2 and 3 was the safe Tamil fallback line (used when the LLM reply is empty, fails or is blocked; the log does not say which).
- **SMS:** Tamil SMS (Mudichur, 5 on a roof, waist-deep, pregnant woman) → high 68, located, Tamil reply asking about injuries and medicines. **Finding (fixed after the run, re-checked with unit tests only):** a romanised-Hindi SMS ("Saidapet bridge ke paas hum 3 log hain, paani kamar tak…") was stored as `ta-IN` and answered in Tamil: `detect_lang` returns `en-IN` for Latin script, so the language comes from the LLM's `caller_language`, which said Tamil for a Chennai locality. Fix: `romanised_lang()` checks common romanised Hindi and Tamil words (2+ hits and a clear lead) before the LLM's guess (2 tests).
- **Dispatch / broadcast / CAP:** Mudichur dispatched (NDRF Boat 1, ETA 40 min). Broadcast in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, English rendered by Timbre (MP3); Tamil kept அடையாறு, Hindi and Telugu kept "Adyar", "Kotturpuram", "Saidapet" in Latin script. CAP 1.2 XML downloaded. No 429s in the server log.
- **UI fix:** at 390 px the top-bar subtitle ran under the "Gnani live" pill; it now ends with an ellipsis.
- Screenshots: `docs/screenshots/product/`. About 45 Gnani requests in total (3 calls, 2 broadcasts, callers' audio, fillers).

## Tue 10 Nov 22:12, `feat/cl-interpreter`, rescuer interpreter live check (CL)
- **Setup:** real Gnani + Groq (`qwen/qwen3.8-27b`), `scripts/interpret_live_check.py`. Synthetic speakers made with Timbre: a rescuer in Hindi ("Shubham": "हम नाव लेकर आ रहे हैं। आपके घर के पास कौन सी बड़ी इमारत है?", 4.0 s) and a caller in Tamil ("Kalpana": Velachery bus depot, third floor, 4 people, 5.4 s). Each clip was sent to `/ws/interpret` as 16 kHz PCM in 100 ms frames at real-time pace, like a held push-to-talk button. 6 Gnani requests (2 Timbre to make the voices, 2 Prisma REST, 2 Timbre for the translations) and 2 Groq calls, one at a time; the run finished without errors.
- **Rescuer → caller (Hindi → Tamil):** Prisma wrote the Hindi exactly. Translation: "நாம் படகை எடுத்து வந்து கொண்டிருக்கிறோம். உங்கள் வீட்டருகில் எந்த பெரிய கட்டிடம் உள்ளது?" (meaning kept and still a question; it used the inclusive "நாம்" where "நாங்கள்" is the natural "we"). Spoken by Timbre "Chetana". Prisma's reported latency 150 ms, Prisma REST round trip 375 ms, translation 406 ms, Timbre 1,516 ms: **2.3 s from release to the translated audio being ready**.
- **Caller → rescuer (Tamil → Hindi):** Prisma: "வேளச்சேரி bus depot பக்கத்தில் இருக்கோம். மூணாவது மாடியில் நாங்கள் நான்கு பேர் இருக்கோம்." (it wrote the spoken "4" as the word நான்கு and kept "bus depot" in Latin script). Translation: "वेलचचेरी बस डिपो के पास हैं। तीसरी मंजिल पर हम चार लोग हैं।": floor and head count kept; Velachery came out as "वेलचचेरी" (one extra letter, still readable). Spoken by Timbre "Prakash". Prisma 194 ms, round trip 422 ms, translation 203 ms, Timbre 1,016 ms: **1.6 s from release to audio**.
- No translation was withheld in this run, so the guard fallback is covered by unit tests only (`test_interpreter`: an added time, an added "you are safe", an invented number and a dropped number each fall back to the speaker's own words). Timbre is the largest step because the whole clip is rendered before playback; streaming it would cut the wait.
- Recording (timeline, input clips and Timbre clips): `frontend/demo/interpret/`, replayed by "Play a recorded interpretation" in the static demo.
